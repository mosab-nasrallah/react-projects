this project is to complex for my current understanding , but i managed to solve it after somehow

 Previous render            Next render

   ------------------------------------------------------

1. useState                   useState

2. useState                   useState

3. useState                   useState

4. useEffect                  useEffect

5. useState                   useState

6. undefined                  useEffect 
this disgusting error took means:


  const url = "https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=52772";

  const { data, loading, error } = useAxios(url); <----hook Number 1

  const [ingredients, setIngredients] = useState([]); <----hook Number 2

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  const meal = data.meals[0];

  console.log(meal);

  useEffect(() => { ....     <----hook Number 3
  },[meal])

the hook number 3 was the problem , why?
because , first , it turns out that hooks should be called at the top level of the components, 
but   
if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>; <---- from the custom useAxios hook

this conditional return when the component first mount, it is true because there is no data yet, until the data is fetched, it will stays true, 
so on the FIRST render of the component, 

HOOK NUMBER 1 RUNS FINE
HOOK NUMBER 2 RUNS FINE
BUT 
HOOK NUMBER 3 DOES NOT RUN AT ALL BECAUSE WE RETURNED EARLY.

therefore any code comes after it will not be executed,

so ON THE FIRST RENDER it sees only 5 hooks (useAxios Hook has 4 inside of it)

  //const { data, loading, error } = useAxios(url); -destructured   ✓  ⌉
                                                                    ✓  |
                                                                    ✓  ↓
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);                READ ✓        ⌉
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);          READ ✓        |
  useEffect(() => {...}, [url])                          READ ✓        |
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);              READ ✓        ⌋

  const [ingredients, setIngredients] = useState([]);    READ ✓
  if (loading) return <div>Loading</div>; STILL TRUE   RETURN ✕ 

  useEffect(() => {...}, [meal])                     NOT READ ✕       

THE SECOND RENDER 

  const [data, setData] = useState(null);                READ ✓        ⌉
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);          READ ✓        |
  useEffect(() => {...}, [url])                          READ ✓        |
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);              READ ✓        ⌋

  const [ingredients, setIngredients] = useState([]);    READ ✓
  if (loading) return <div>Loading</div>; FALSE        SKIPED ✓

  useEffect(() => {...}, [meal])                         READ ✓  

  
  so the second render it saw 6 hooks , this caused a problem
  the fix is simple, we need to check if the data is null and puting the condisional return after the useEffect so it can see the 6th hook on the first render thus preventing the early return, 

    const meal = data ? data.meals[0] : null;
      useEffect(() => {
        if (!meal) return; ---> we outplay react by exiting by ourselfs respectfully instead of getting kicked out
        //the rest of the code...
        }, [meal])

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
